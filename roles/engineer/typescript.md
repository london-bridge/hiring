# Full Stack Engineer (TypeScript/React)

We’re not looking for rockstars, zombies, or magicians. We’re looking for motivated, creative, and resourceful developers who take pride in their work and want to partner with clients who are pushing the boundaries of the technology we work with.

Software Developers at London Bridge work collaboratively to understand the challenges facing our clients and implement effective and meaningful technological solutions, frequently using Typescript. Your responsibilities will range from technical discovery that informs custom feature builds to custom architecture and development to large-scale payment transactions.

Software Developers at London Bridge need to be well-rounded technologists who have a holistic understanding of the web technology stacks that we work with, are excited about keeping our team at the cutting edge, and are eager to work directly with clients to help them solve interesting and novel business problems.

London Bridge is an equal opportunity employer and we seek to increase diversity in the tech industry. We encourage applications from women, Black people, indigenous people, people of color, 2SLGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and other communities traditionally underrepresented in this field.
