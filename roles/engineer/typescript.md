# Full Stack Engineer (TypeScript/React)

We’re not looking for rockstars, zombies, or magicians. We’re looking for motivated, creative, and resourceful developers who take pride in their work and want to partner with clients who are pushing the boundaries of the technology we work with.

Software Developers at London Bridge work collaboratively to understand the challenges facing our clients and implement effective and meaningful technological solutions, frequently using TypeScript. Your responsibilities will range from technical discovery that informs custom feature builds to custom architecture and development to large-scale payment transactions.

Software Developers at London Bridge need to be well-rounded technologists who have a holistic understanding of the web technology stacks that we work with, are excited about keeping our team at the cutting edge, and are eager to work directly with clients to help them solve interesting and novel business problems.

London Bridge is an equal opportunity employer and we seek to increase diversity in the tech industry. We encourage applications from women, Black people, indigenous people, people of color, 2SLGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and other communities traditionally underrepresented in this field. To learn more about how London Bridge values diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), read our [DEI pledge](/DEI.md).

## Qualifications

- This is not an entry-level position. We expect candidates to have some professional experience writing software. Seasoned developers will flourish with our balance of independence and support, while entry-level developers would not get the direct oversight they need to succeed.
- Our primary development language is **TypeScript**. You must be fully fluent in **TypeScript** and have worked with it in a professional context before.
- Prior experience with **Next.js** and/or **Nest.js** is a major plus. If you haven’t worked with either, you should be excited to learn and develop with them.
- We make heavy use of ES Next JavaScript (particularly React, as well as Node) and related tooling, including webpack. Previous experience is a plus, and a willingness to learn it is essential.
- London Bridge prides itself on its ability to address unusual, novel, and complex problems that deal with the intersection of technology, business, and content production. You should understand and be able to discuss web technologies and systems conceptually, and be able to demonstrate that you can learn a new language, technology stack, or framework quickly and on demand.
- You should feel comfortable at a **Unix command line**, even if you aren’t an expert.
- You must know your way around **git** and understand version control well, and be able to carry out typical operations with it, including branching, merging, submitting code for peer review, and reviewing your peers’ code yourself.
- We apply **Scrum** as a development methodology, and broadly endorse **Agile** as a philosophy. You must be open to working this way as well, and prior experience is a plus.
- You should also have very strong **written and verbal communication skills**, and the ability to wield them with both team members and clients.
- Discipline concerning **delivery dates, stylistic appreciation** of what makes code good and readable, and a **committed attitude** about documentation, user stories, issue tracking, and timesheets are all very important skills for our developers to have.

## Benefits

- Competitive salaries – We recognize several levels of career progression for developers and tie compensation to those levels corresponding to their seniority and experience. If you consider yourself to be at a higher level, we still encourage you to apply and can discuss additional opportunities with you!
- Flexible time off policy
- Remote first – We are a fully distributed company, meaning we don’t have a set work location. Team members can choose to work from home or from a co-working space. We’ll furnish your home office or rent you a co-working space.

**Recruiters**: Please do **NOT** contact us about this job. All hiring duties at London Bridge are carried out by our staff.
