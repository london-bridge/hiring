<!-- You must provide at least one link to a specific code sample with your application. This is your chance to show off your skills with code that you’re proud of and that reflects your abilities that wouldn’t otherwise be captured in a resume or cover letter. We recommend that at least one of your code samples demonstrate TypeScript knowledge. Candidates who provide multiple code samples with their application are more likely to be offered an interview. Here are some tips on selecting great code samples. -->

<!-- It’s OK if you didn’t write 100% of the code you submit because you were part of a team that worked on it together, or because it includes open source components. In these cases, please explain what your specific contributions to the codebase were. -->

<!-- Code samples are an invaluable tool in helping us understand you as a developer. We know that gathering code samples can be time consuming so we only require one sample to start. However, please note that if you advance in the interview process, we may request additional code samples later in the process. -->
